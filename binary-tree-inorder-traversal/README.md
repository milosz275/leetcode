# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal

## Difficulty

Easy

## Question

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example 1:**

    Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
    Output: [1,3,2]

**Example 2:**

    Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,8,null,null,6,7,9]
    Output: [4,2,6,5,7,1,3,9,8]

**Example 3:**

    Input: root = []
    Output: []

**Example 4:**

    Input: root = [1]
    Output: [1]

**Constraints:**

    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
    -100 <= Node.val <= 100

**Follow up:**

    Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Solution

Solution uses stack to traverse through the tree visiting the left subtree first, then root, and finally right subtree.
