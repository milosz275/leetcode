**Note:**

## Question

Given an input string `s`, reverse the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```
