# Leetcode

[![CodeQL](https://github.com/mldxo/leetcode/actions/workflows/codeql.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mldxo/leetcode/actions/workflows/codeql.yml)

This is a repository for my solutions to Leetcode problems. I will be solving problems in C, at least one daily. I will also be providing explanations for my solutions. There will be updates to this repository as I solve more problems. Coding convention in this repo snake_case, which is not compatible with Leetcode's convention.
