# 44. Wildcard Matching

## Difficulty

Hard

## Question

Given an input string (`s`) and a pattern (`p`), implement wildcard pattern matching with support for `'?'` and `'*'` where:

`'?'` Matches any single character.
`'*'` Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence).
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

**Example:**

```
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
```
